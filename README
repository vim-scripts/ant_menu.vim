A simple script that provides a pull-down menu and keyboard shortcuts for calling ant, a java build 
utility.  By default, ant.vim assumes that the build.xml file is in the current directory.  The user can 
set the build file in another directory by selecting the "Set build file" option or by using ",s" in 
command mode. 

Global options can be set in your .vimrc file.      For example:

let g:buildFile = 'foo.xml'
let g:antOption = '-debug'
let g:logFile = 'foo.log'

If you are on a windows box and you cannot see compilation errors in your quickfix window,
try setting the shellpipe to "2>" in your _vimrc.
